# Poker
Poker Project OOP Fall '19

-- This project is a game replicating the game of poker. 

-- It will be a game between two, the player (you) and the computer.

-- It is a very basic version of poker where you can bet on hands and win and lose the in-game currency.

-- After you download all the classes (Card, Hand, Player, Poker), you can run the program by running the poker class.

-- The game will then prompt you to enter your name and then it will begin. 

-- At the end of the it all, it is to have fun.

-- Thank you and I hope you enjoy the results.
